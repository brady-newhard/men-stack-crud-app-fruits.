- CRUD
Create Things in database
Read Things from database
Update things already in the database
Delete things in the database

- Apps w/ MVC Architecture
Useful when multiple resources are in play
  - Users, Fruits, Vegetables, Candies, etc.

- Try/Catch (JS Foundations)
Try/Catch is independent of CRUD (core JS)
Its purpose is to handle expected errors
Often tied to a "network call" (CRUD operations, or 3rd party API calls. DB operations or HTTP requests)


- RESTful routing



- Queries! (very important)
  - find({}) // takes an object { name: "Apple" }
  - findById("1234123412") // takes a string
